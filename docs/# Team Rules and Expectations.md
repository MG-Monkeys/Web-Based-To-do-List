## Core Principles

### 1. Communication First ("No Surprises" Rule)

- If you can't complete your work by the deadline, notify the team leader **at least 24 hours in advance**
- If you face personal challenges affecting your work, communicate early
- We accommodate challenges when we know about them - we don't accommodate silence

### 2. Weekly Responsibilities

- Update your individual Canvas page **by Friday 11:59 PM** each week
- Include your progress, LoC, and completed tests
- Missing updates = missing contributions in team presentation

### 3. Meeting Attendance

- **Weekly team meetings:** [Day/Time]
- If you can't attend, notify the team **before** the meeting
- Review meeting notes if you miss a meeting

## Work Standards

### Code Quality

- All code must pass unit tests before pushing to main branch
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Follow project coding standards (see `/docs/coding_standards.md`)

### Documentation

- Document your features as you build them
- Update relevant diagrams when making architectural changes
- Keep your individual Canvas page current

### Review Process

- Each dev has their own branch. 
- When feature/requirement is completed - create a pull request, and let the leader review it

## Conflict Resolution

1. Be adults - if you disagree talk it out. If no resolution come to the leader and present both sides. 

## Peer Evaluation Criteria

Team members will be evaluated on:
